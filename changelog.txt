* Fixed

- Added the_content filter on popup content so that it can be treated the same way as a normal post.
- The issue was that <p> tags were not being added so all lines ended up on one line. The wpautop filter which added <p> tags is one of the filters used in the_content so I just used that.
- I also used wp_kses_post for extra sanitization when pulling from the DB but this removes custom HTML. I found that get_post_by_title() uses get_post() which uses sanitize_post() so this is happening by default.
