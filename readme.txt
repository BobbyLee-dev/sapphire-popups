A simple yet powerful plugin that creates popups.

== Description ==

Sapphire Popups allows you to easily add popups and set the behavior of how the popup is displayed all without the use of cookies. It is compatible with the Classic Editor and Gutenberg which makes it easy to use, it's also very approachable for developers to extend.

Major Features in Sapphire Popups include:

* Easily create and manage popups using the Classic Editor or Gutenberg.
* 3 popup behavior selections.
* If a popup is updated it will be displayed again, even if the behavior has not expired.
* Remove popup title option.
* Does not use cookies.

Behavior selections:

* Default: Display popup on every page load.
* Show Daily: Popup will be displayed once per day.
* Show Once: Popup will show only once ever - unless behavior is changed or popup had been updated.

Popups that get updated will be displayed again even if the behavior is set to Show Once. If the behavior is set to Show Daily and the popup is updated it will be displayed again and the daily timer will start over. This allows for updates to be made even after the popup has been displayed.
